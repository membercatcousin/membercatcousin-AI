### WARNING : THIS AI IS NOT FOR COMMERCIAL USE AND ONLY FOR EDUCATIONAL/ENTERTAINMENT PURPUSES.

A continuation of VOXELWARE AI due to the organisation having a clear goal (spoiler: AI is not one of them)

## Why?
Most AIs are corporate-coded, heavy, and boring. **membercatcousin-AI** is:
- **0% Neural:** No LLMs, no GPU usage, no bloat.
- **100% Algorithmic:** High-speed keyword matching and silent typo correction.
- **Modular:** Built with a `bootstrap` architecture.
- **Cross-Platform:** Works in your Terminal and on Discord.

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**
- **PyYAML** (for configuration)
- **Discord.py** (for the bot)
- **JSON** (for the brain)

## Future Path:

- Algorithmic responses instead of traditional neural networks
- built-in 'How to' tutorials
- EVEN MORE STUFF

## Installation
1. Clone the repo.
2. `pip requirements.txt`
4. `python3 main.py` for Terminal mode.
5. `python3 discord_bot.py` for Discord mode.

## Contributing
This is an open-source project under the **MIT License**. Feel free to submit Pull Requests to `responses.json` to add more vibes to the brain.
